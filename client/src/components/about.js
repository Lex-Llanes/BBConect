        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
        Our country is in the midst of a longstanding Black maternal health crisis. In 2021, for the first time in over 6 years, the United States finally saw a reduction in preterm birth rates, one of the leading causes of infant death. However, this was not the case for Black Americans whose preterm birth rates increased. Clinical and behavioral health interventions have done little to address persistent racial disparities in adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. Interpersonal, institutional, and structural racism are at the root of this issue.</p>
        <br/>

        <h3>A Solution</h3>
        <p>Black Birth Connect helps connect Black women and birthing people to find resources and social support that are tailored to organizatons that serve and assist Black communities. In BBConnect users will be able to find resources such as: volunteers for child care assitance, search for topics relevant to them, find the tea (open discussions with other users), and build a local / online community. </p>
